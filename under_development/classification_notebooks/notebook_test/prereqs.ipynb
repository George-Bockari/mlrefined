    "While we won't be drowning in equations in this class, there will come a point in our discussion of each course topic where we must use turn to the language of mathematics in order sufficiently flush out each idea and develop appropriate machine learning algorithms. Thankfully in order to do this we'll only need basic concepts from linear algebra and calculus in order to succeed. If you haven't seen vectors, matrices, or derivatives for a while - don't sweat it. In this section we review the requisite concepts - fundamentally there are only two: how do you add matrices? and how do you take derivatives?"
