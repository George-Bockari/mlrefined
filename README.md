## Video tutorial on regression and L2 regularization

Below is an older video tutorial illustrating how L2 regularization convexifies nonconvex cost functions, thereby making minimization of such functions easier.  The code (l2reg_logistic, which you may find here) shows the result of applying L2 regularization to a nonconvex form of logistic regression on a simple dataset, as well as the resulting convexificaation of this cost function due to regularization.   Again, some principles from the chapter - which is available for download at www.mlrefined.com -  are briefly described before jumping into the code.
